# CSARCH2 Group 4
 This projects simulates the **Full Associative / Most Recently Used (FA/MRU)** cache memory replacement algorithm. This applications asks for inputs *block size*, *main memory size (in words or blocks)*, *cache memory size (in words or blocks)*, *memory access time*, *cache access time*, *main memory values*, and *number of time to add the *. After inputting valid values, you will see the simulation of how the data is stored in the cache memory. Finally, you will see the results of *cache hits*, *cache miss*, *average memory access time*, *total memory access time*, and a *snapshot of the cache memory*.
